# DSA in JavaScript

This repository contains solutions to a variety of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems implemented in **JavaScript**. It is designed to help developers and learners sharpen their problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

The repository includes solutions and explanations for common DSA topics, such as:

- **Arrays & Strings**
- **HashMaps & Sets**
- **Two Pointers & Sliding Window**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Trees & Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**

Each solution is carefully explained with detailed code comments, and edge cases are handled wherever applicable. This project aims to provide optimized and efficient solutions that focus on best practices.
